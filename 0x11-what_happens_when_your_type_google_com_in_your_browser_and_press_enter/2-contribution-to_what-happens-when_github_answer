 Resolution
After the "g" key is pressed, the browser first checks its DNS cache to find the IP address associated with the domain name. If the IP isn't cached, it sends a query to the DNS resolver configured on the machine, typically the ISP's DNS server. The DNS server performs recursive queries starting from the root DNS servers, down to the authoritative DNS server for the domain, which provides the IP address.
